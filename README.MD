# Rails GraphQL + NextJS + Apollo

That's my sample project using a Ruby on Rails backend + NextJS + Apollo client

## How to start the Applications?

As I am using docker on this project we can run the command below and it will build the docker images and start our Applications. However, if you don't have the Docker installed on your machine, please [click here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and download it.

```bash
$ docker-compose up api
```
Also I created a service called `api-unit-test` for running the unit tests on the Docker, if needed
